<strong>Instructions:</strong>
The instructions on how to install and use this application are in the 'Instructions.txt' file in the "Installation" Directory.


<strong>Project Description:</strong>

The application is run out of the 'Program' Folder, and is run with the 'main.py' file. The software will display all the rows from the database -- with the corresponding ids, names, amounts, units, and expiration dates. 

Under the 'File' menu in the menubar, you are able to look at the past, saved, inventory. When you click this 'Past Inventory' button, you are then prompted to select one of the dates that you have saved inventory for, which when submitted, the inventory for that dates appears in a grid with comparison percentages.

Under the 'Update' menu in the menubar, you have the option to add items to the database, delete items from the database, or update the values of the amounts and expiration dates of the current items in the inventory sheet. Each one of these functions have an option in the menu.

Under the 'Save' Menu, there is an option to save, or 'Post', inventory for the day which saves all the current day's inventory counts. These amounts can be retrieved through another button under the 'File' menu.

To run this program, run the command 'python main.py' under the 'Program' Directory.
